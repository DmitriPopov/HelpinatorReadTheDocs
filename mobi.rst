You might also need a MOBI viewer (Mobipocket Reader for example or  `Kindle Previewer <http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765261>`_).


Note that you can add a cover page image to your ebook (actually Amazon suggests you have one). Just put a file named syscoverpage.jpg into the project's image library and Helpinator will use it as a cover page for your ebook.
