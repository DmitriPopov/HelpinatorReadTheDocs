Organizing text reviews
=========================


Helpinator allows you to organize text reviews by team members not involved in authoring process. For example, you have a dedicated tech writer and a group of developers and experts who are concentrated on development and communicate with a tech writer only occasionally. You need to organize help project reviews, say, once a month, when other team members can read documentation and leave their comments. The problem is how to connect comments and topic content without affecting it.


With Helpinator you have two ways to do it:


1. "Notes" tab in the topic editor allows you to write any topic-related text there.
2. "COMMENT" ` conditional compilation <#t807CF7472FA741D783D86FC323F142FA>`_ tag allows you to skip part of the topic from compilation. Hence, you can write comments inside COMMENT tags right in the place where they should be.
