EPUB (from Wikipedia) (short for electronic publication; alternatively capitalized as ePub, ePUB, EPub, or epub, with "EPUB" preferred by the vendor) is a free and open e-book standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub.

Helpinator allows you to create EPUB books with one mouse click. All you have to do is:


1. Select template for this format in project options.

2. Install one of the available EPUB viewers to preview compiled ebook. For example you can use CoolReader:

HTML Templates for EPUB/MOBI formats are different from those used in CHM/WebHelp/QtHelp/JavaHelp. Though they too have <templatename.html> and <templatename.css> files, their logical structure is different:


1. Default HTML file defines how a book page looks like.
2. There are 2 additional HTML files: front.html and toc.html, the first for "front page" with title, author and etc and the second is for the table of contents.
3. Default CSS file is for all 3 template HTML files.
