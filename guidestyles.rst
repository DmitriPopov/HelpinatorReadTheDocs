Guide Styles
==============


Guide styles allow you to change appearance of Step-by-step Guides in compiled documentation. Most of it Helpinator uses only when compiling CHM and WebHelp, PDF/RTF/Printed Manuals do not use "slideshow" effect, so only font settings will be taken into account when compiling them.

Here you have more control over Guide appearance in this kind of documentation, but be careful.
