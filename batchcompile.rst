Batch Compile
===============


Clicking on toolbar icons to get output is time-consuming when you need multiple formats at once. That's why Helpinator allows you to create "batches" that consist of several "tasks". Each task allows to compile selected output format with pre-selected language and variable preset and then save it to the specified location.


You can save batches to external xml files or into the project itself. In the latter case you can access them with a drop-down on the main tool bar.
