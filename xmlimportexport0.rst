XML Import/Export
===================


XML Import/Export allows you to communicate with translation services and software. In general the procedure is as follows:


1. Say you have a one-language project with "English" default language.
2. Add new language, for example "German" and check to copy default language to it.
3. Export XML using "Main Menu->File->Export XML". Select "German" language and folder to export files to.
4. Helpinator will create a set of XML files with topics, keywords and glossary terms.
5. Send this files to your translation service or translate it with translation software.
6. Import translated XML back using "Main Menu->File->Import XML". Select "German" as destination language and a folder where XML files are located.
