====================
Topics and Content
====================


Topics are the basis of your help project. Topics may contain formatted text, tables, images, code and text snippets, step-by-step guides. Topics have language-specific title, project-wide unique ID, context ID to connect to your app and a list of assigned keywords.


You can assign tasks and notes to topics for advanced management purposes. Topics also may be skipped from output based on a set of conditions.


Topic editor UI is similar to any other text processor UI with some additions related to Helpinator and help authoring in general.
