Quickly update screenshots when UI changes
============================================


Helpinator has three main features that help you to update screenshots quickly:



1. `Image Library <#tD1C9F4A436CF43E7A91897077A11B3C2>`_. When you store all screenshots in the image library you don't need to browse through all topics to find screenshots that you need to alter.
2. `Screeshot REcapture <#tCCEB031BC54849DE88CC0C021BADE432>`_. This feature allows you to REcapture screenshots that are stored in the image library. Image name remains the same as well as added callouts/annotations.
3. `"Cloned" Images <#t5890F9CEE0ED4E1EAB467299DE7A456D>`_. Clones share the same image with "donor" but each has it's own callouts/annotations. When UI changes you only need to update "donor" images and Helpinator updates clones automatically.
